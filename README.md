✈️ Airline Management System (DSA – Java)
📌 Project Description

A Java-based Airline Management System designed to automate core airline operations such as user registration, login, flight management, seat selection, ticket booking, viewing, and cancellation. The project applies Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts for efficient data handling and uses Java Swing to provide a simple and user-friendly graphical interface. It demonstrates the practical use of DSA in a real-world airline management scenario.
